# 👪🌳 Family Tree Migration AP Human Website ✈️

This is a crazy ambitious project that I will be completing in under 15 days. I am essentially learning how to use TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite, Node.js, and React all at once. I will likely Dockerize this project once it is done, and create documentation to refer to in the future.
